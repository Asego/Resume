#C++
My C++ projects. Currently, I have 3 projects as listed below.
Camview is a program I wrote to figure out how to use opencv, a library for image capture and manipulation.
Serv is a program to make a basic HTTP server. It could easily be modified to host a more complicated HTML page than it currently does, and should be able to include other browser-friendly languages.
Camserv3 is (the third version of) a program made to capture an image and return it in response to an HTTP request to an HTML server.
